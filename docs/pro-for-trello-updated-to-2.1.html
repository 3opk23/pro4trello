			<h2 class="docs-header center">Optimized loading, performance and stability fixes</h2>
			<p>
				Yes - there were some issues when loading the extension.
				Sometimes cards would dissapear, sometimes the Pro4Trello menu wouldn't appear.
				But that's all in the past. And it all just works so much faster now <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>

			<h2 class="docs-header center">Persistent Group/Project Filters</h2>
			<p>
				When you filter cards by groups/projects - your choice is now saved across your Chrome browsers, just like other board settings.
				There's also a nice indicator when a filter is active.

				You can now make your board very classy and compact:

				<h2 class="title">A quick FAQ</h2>

				<p>Let's try to answer a couple of repeating questions on the support board:</p>

				<h3>Why are Pro4Trello settings per board?</h3>
				<p>
					Trello is (amongst other things) designed for both teams and individuals.
					When you’re sharing your boards with other people you can’t always impose the way you form card/task titles to everyone.
					When you’re all alone, it makes sense to have unique settings for all Trello boards, but that just can’t work when you’re involved in a lot of teams with different approaches to organizing boards.
				</p>

				<h3>Why are time entries displayed with a calculator icon?</h3>
				<p>
					The clock icon is used by Trello for the due date/time.
					After some research on the topic and coming up with this term called "calculated time", the time entry label looked okay with the calculator icon.
				</p>

				<h3>What happened with your feature request?</h3>
				<p>
					Look, you've all been awesome at reviewing Pro for Trello, suggesting new features and (more often) pointing out it's flaws.
					The thing is - time is a valuable resource and right now it was used to fix, improve and optimize Pro for Trello. Please stay patient
					until the time comes for your feature request to be a part of one of the next versions. And rest assured it will.
				</p>
